# Mass-Mailer
This program uses Yagmail to send emails on the behalf of the user's email. Thus, you will need to disable a security setting in your Google Account. I recommend using a new account for this, as your main account could be at risk. With your new account, go to https://myaccount.google.com/ and sign in. Go to security and make sure 2FA and "Use your phone to sign in" are turned off. You should see a section named "Less secure app access." Go ahead and turn this on. Now, you are able to tun this program with your spare account. In the program's code, replace the current email and password in place that correspond to your account's credentials in the main.py. In the csv.csv, replace the name, email, and message sections with who you want to send the message to. Have fun!
